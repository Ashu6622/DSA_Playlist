What is subsequence ?
--> if x is a subsequence of y then all characters of x should be present in y, and in same order.
Example x = "adk" , y = "hatidpkq"
here characters can occur multiple times

so-> x = "adk" and y = "hatidpkq", now x is a subsequence of y, because every characters of x appears in y and in same order i.e 'd' 
comes after 'a' , 'k' comes after 'a' and 'd' and like wise
