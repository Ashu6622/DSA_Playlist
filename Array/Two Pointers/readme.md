Types of two pointers problem
1) When the pointers starts from both ends --> i = 0 , j = n-1
2) When pointers from same end -> i = 0, j = 0 or i = n-1 , j = n-1
Slow and Fast Pointers
3) When one pointers start from one end and other start from middle of array ->
i = 0, j = n/2 or i = n-1 , j = n/2;
