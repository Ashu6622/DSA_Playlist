What is Cummulative Sum
A cumulative sum, also known as a running total, is the sum of all data points up to a certain point in time

very important approach, for check if n is the perfect cube of 3 or not

        double x = log10(n)/log10(3);

        return x == floor(x);


From BFS traversal we always get the minimum steps to reach from source to destination
