Dijkstra algorithm can be used for shortest path calculation for
1) directed and undirected weighted graph
2) directed acyclic weighted graph
3) work for both cyclic and acyclic graph

For Directed Acyclic Graph we can use topological sort algorithm

Cycle Detection in Graph
1) Cycle Detection in Undirected graph using DFS
2) Cycle Detection in Undirected gragh using BFS
3) Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using BFS called Kahn's algorithm
4) Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using DFS
