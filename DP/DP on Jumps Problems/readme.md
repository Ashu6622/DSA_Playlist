In jump game option are equal to the values of every elements, at every index
Example = [2, 3, 1, 4], here there are four elements index 0, 1, 2, 3. So, on index 0 I have 2 options weather to take 1 jump or 2 jump from index 0, again on index 1 I have three option weather to take 1, 2 or 3 jump from index 1, and like wise for every index
So, in recursive solution these jumps are calculated using loop, i.e for every element there will be loop from 1 to x, where x is the value of element on that index, and this indicates the jump
