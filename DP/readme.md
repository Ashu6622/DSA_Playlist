Dp means try all possibilities and pick up the best one


Longest Increasing Subsequence
    1) length of LIS
    2) Count LIS
    3) Print LIS


Subsequence never repeate itself
example -> [3,5,4,7] ===> in this {3,4,7} is one of the subsequence, and it will never repeate i.e {3,4,7} as a subsequence will neve comes again
